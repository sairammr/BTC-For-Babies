# 🍼 Bitcoin for Babies

**Bitcoin for Babies** is a DeFi + DApp project that helps kids under 18 save Bitcoin by completing real-world tasks assigned by their parents. The app uses **gamification** (like digital pets) to keep children engaged, while BTC rewards are securely stored in a hidden wallet, unlockable when they turn 18.
